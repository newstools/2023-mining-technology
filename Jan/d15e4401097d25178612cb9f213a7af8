Tertiary Minerals has received the environmental project brief (EPB) approval for the Mushima North copper project in Zambia. Received via the company’s subsidiary Mwashia Resources, the EPB has been approved by the Zambian Environmental Management Agency. Tertiary Minerals said the EPB approval marks a crucial permit needed prior to the start of the field exploration programme. Tertiary Minerals executive chairman Patrick Cheetham said: “I am delighted to report that we have received EPB approval for the Mushima North Copper Project where we are currently working through the shared FQM data in preparation for the coming field exploration season. “On a recent visit to Zambia in December, our exploration manager recovered sulphide mineralised drill core from a drill hole completed in the 1960s at Mushima North which reportedly tested an extensive copper-in-soil anomaly and intersected wide zones of low-grade copper mineralisation. “We will be assaying this core shortly to validate this early target.” Located 100km east of Manyinga, the Mushima North project is located within the exploration licence 27068-HQ-LEL that covers an area of 701.3km². The licence comprises basement rocks outside of the conventional copper belt and the area is said to host iron-oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits. In September 2022, Tertiary Minerals signed a technical cooperation agreement with First Quantum Minerals for the Mushima North and Mukai copper exploration projects. Under the agreement, both companies will form a technical committee to jointly advance the exploration and development of the two projects. First Quantum Minerals will provide all its historical exploration data for the two licence areas.
