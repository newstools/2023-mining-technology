Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) has teamed up with Canada’s Ballard Power Systems and Ashok Leyland to develop a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck (FCET) for mining and logistics sectors in India. AEL will lead the demonstration project, which marks the first planned hydrogen-powered mining truck in Asia. As part of the collaboration, Ballard will be responsible for the supply of the FCmove fuel cell engine for the hydrogen truck while Ashok Leyland will provide the vehicle platform and technical support. The partners plan to launch the FCET in India in 2023. Expected to weigh 55t, the truck will feature three hydrogen tanks and a 200km working range. It will be powered by Ballard’s 120kW PEM fuel cell technology. Ballard Power Systems CEO Randy MacEwen said: “Our technology offers a strong value proposition for their heavy-duty mining truck with our zero-emission engines providing long range, rapid refuelling and heavy payload capabilities.” Earlier, Adani Group unveiled plans to invest over $50bn in green hydrogen and associated ecosystems, over the next ten years. Adani Enterprises Limited director and Adani Natural Resources CEO Vinay Prakash said: “This pioneering and ambitious green hydrogen project holds a strong promise for India’s future energy self-reliance and is consistent with the vision of Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, of accelerating the use of hydrogen-powered fuel cell technology in the commercial transport system. “This experience of handling hydrogen as a fuel for commercial fleets not only prepones the advent of hydrogen technology for the mining and logistics sector in the country but will also enable other businesses to opt for long-term sustainable solutions transitioning fleets in ports, airports and in their industrial operations.”
