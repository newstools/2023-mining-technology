Fluor Corporation has received a contract to provide engineering, procurement and construction management services (EPCM) for the Skouries gold-copper mining project in Greece. The contract has been awarded by Hellas Gold Single Member, a wholly-owned unit of Eldorado Gold. Under the contract, Fluor will be responsible for infrastructure, non-process facilities, process area and tailings filtration. Located within the Halkidiki Peninsula of Greece, the Skouries high-grade gold-copper porphyry deposit is expected to have an average annual production capacity of 140,000oz of gold and 67 million pounds of copper over its initial mine life of 20 years. Fluor Mining & Metals business president Tony Morgan said: “The execution of this project will build on Fluor’s technical expertise in large-scale gold and copper projects. “Fluor is excited to be a part of this important project that will drive economic development in the region and provide the essential raw materials to support the transition to a more sustainable future.” Fluor’s Vancouver office will be the project’s lead office. The work will be supported by the firm’s New Delhi and Calgary offices. Led by Fluor’s Greece office, the onshore construction management and detailed engineering work will be carried out by a consortium of Greek engineering service companies. This project is expected to create up to 800 construction jobs and 1,400 long-term jobs once operational. Construction on the mine is planned to start this year, with first production anticipated in the second half of 2025. The Skouries project forms part of the overall Kassandra Mines Complex, which also includes the Olympias Mine, the Stratoni Port Facility and the Kokkinolakkas Tailings Management Facility.
