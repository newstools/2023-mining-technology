Alpha Lithium has obtained drilling licences for its properties in the Salar del Hombre Muerto (Hombre Muerto) in Argentina. The firm plans to start exploration operations on its lithium asset in Salta Province before the end of this month. As part of the drilling work scheduled over the next 12 months, Alpha plans to drill up to 12 wellbores on its more than 5,000ha Hombre Muerto property. The company also looks to implement several new vertical electrical sounding (VES) campaigns at the property. Alpha president and CEO Brad Nichol said: “To finally commence operations at Hombre Muerto is an incredibly exciting, game-changing moment for Alpha and its shareholders. “Having developed Tolillar to a point where it continues to attract significant industry interest, our team can focus on expanding and repeating its past two years of rapid success in Tolillar, now, in Hombre Muerto.” Alpha said the Hombre Muerto property comprises the highest lithium brine grades, lowest levels of impurities and highest flow rates in Argentina, making it South America’s one of the most desirable salars. The company is considering the acquisition of an additional land position at Hombre Muerto, which is located 10km-15km from the Tolillar salar. In a press statement, Alpha said: “Hombre Muerto is Argentina’s longest-producing salar, with Livent Corp having produced 20,000tpa of battery-grade lithium for over 25 years.” Alpha operates and controls all of its assets in Argentina through its subsidiary Alpha Lithium Argentina SA.
