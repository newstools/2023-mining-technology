Andromeda Metals has secured approval for the programme for environment protection and rehabilitation (PEPR) at the Great White Project (GWP) in South Australia. The approval has been issued by the South Australian Department for Energy and Mining (DEM). The PEPR marks the second and final stage of the state government’s regulatory process for the Great White kaolin project. It allows the firm to process up to 300,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of ore at the project and produce up to 150,000tpa of halloysite-kaolin product. Andromeda said that the PEPR authorises the staged development of the GWP’s operations and production during the first 13 years of operational life of the Great White kaolin project, which is expected to have 28 years of life-of-mine. Andromeda managing director James Marsh said: “We are very excited to have received approval of the PEPR as it brings Andromeda closer to becoming a globally significant producer of halloysite-kaolin products. “With this important regulatory milestone now achieved, Andromeda is poised to progress towards construction, as we advance funding discussions which will enable a final investment decision.” Located within the District Council of Streaky Bay, near the community of Poochera on the Eyre Peninsula, the GWP comprises several high-value deposits, which includes a naturally occurring blend of halloysite tubes and kaolinite plates. Andromeda will pay up to $3.7m in bonds and $665,000 into the Native Vegetation Fund prior to commencing any operations at the mine.
