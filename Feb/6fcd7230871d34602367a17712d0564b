Angola is aiming for a dual listing for state-owned diamond miner Endiama, reported Reuters citing Angola Mines Minister. The country initially plans an initial public offering for a stake between 5% and 10% in the company on the Angolan stock exchange, following which it will seek a secondary foreign listing. This move forms part of the OPEC member country’s efforts to reform and privatise the economy, including a partial listing of national oil company Sonangol. Russian diamond mining company Alrosa has a joint venture with Endiama in Angola. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, sanctions were imposed by Western nations on several companies, including Alrosa, subsequently impacting Endiama’s operations. Angola Minister of Mineral Resources, Oil and Gas Diamantino Azevedo told the news agency on the sidelines of a mining conference in Cape Town: “Sanctions are there and there is some impact.” Azevedo said the government is considering measures required to avoid impacts on diamond production. The minister noted that the government, however, could go ahead with an initial public offering for Endiama following its restructuring. Azevedo said: “Our goal is (to list) till 30% but will start maybe with five or 10%.” According to Endiama’s document at the mining conference, the firm’s production was about 8.75 million carats for 2022. Between 2022 and 2027, Endiama intends to more than double its diamond production to 17.5 million carats. In September 2022, Bloomberg News reported that Angola was looking to sell its 30% stake in Sonangol within the next five years.
